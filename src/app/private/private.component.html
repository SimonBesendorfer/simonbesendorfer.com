                    <h3>Sailing is my passion!</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no better way to spend vacation than on an sailing ship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You thow the ropes and leave the save harbour for a unique adventure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sailing teaches you everytime you are on the see a lesson in humility. On the sea you are very
                        weak and insignificant against the force of nataure!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seams to be very uncomfortable to stay with others on a very small yacht.
                        But I believe that exactly this fact is necessary in order to leave the ship not as a stranger
                        in the end, but as friends.

                        Some clich√©s have to be fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The world certainly thinks that every Austrian is born with skis on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ski hiking are probably the most sustainable way to move through the aplen in winter. It also keeps you fit and you can reach the most remote, quiet and beautiful places.

                    <h3>What could be more unique than hand crafted furniture?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am one of three children. Since my father is a carpenter, I discovered my love for wood in my early childhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        Later I learned to work with machines myself to build unique furniture myself.
